### 🌴🍹 Personal Drink Recommender 🍸✨

This is a tool to help you decide what kind of drink you may want, based on your mood and general situation. 

### Instructions

Enter your mood—feelings, general happenings, or simply things you are looking forward to. We will then process that information
and give you a non-alcoholic drink that fits your situation, along with a recipe to follow along.

### API's

All suggested drinks are called from [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/).
Gemini's [API]([url](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)) is used to process our users' inputs.
